# HireFlow AI - Complete Project Blueprint

## Intelligent Job Application & Hiring Agent + Career Prep System

**Track:** AI Agents & Agentic Systems
**Pod Size:** 5 (1 Maintainer + 4 Contributors)
**Duration:** 5 Weeks | 8 Milestones
**Framework:** Build -> Understand -> Defend

---

## The Vision

HireFlow AI is not just a job application bot. It's a **career autopilot** with three distinct value layers:

```
Layer 1: DISCOVER    -> Find and rank the best jobs for YOU
Layer 2: APPLY       -> Tailor resume + apply (within YOUR weekly quota)
Layer 3: PREPARE     -> Give you a battle plan for every application
Layer 4: HIRE (flip) -> Help companies shortlist from their applicant pool
```

The user says:
> "I want to apply to 10 jobs per week. Here's my profile."

HireFlow then:
1. Scrapes and discovers 100+ relevant openings
2. Scores every job against the user's profile
3. Picks the **top 10** (or whatever the user's weekly quota is)
4. For each of those 10: generates a tailored ATS resume, applies, and sends the user back:
   - The **exact resume** used for that application
   - A **preparation guide** (topics, skills, expected rounds, resources)
5. Optionally: flips to the hiring side to shortlist applicants

## Module Deep Dive

### Module 1: User Onboarding & Profile Builder

**What it does:**
User uploads their master resume or fills a structured profile. System extracts and stores: skills, experience, education, projects, target roles, preferred locations, salary expectations, and weekly application quota.

**Key Fields:**

| Field | Type | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| `name` | string | "Rahul Sharma" |
| `email` | string | "rahul@example.com" |
| `master_resume` | file (PDF) | Uploaded PDF |
| `skills` | list | ["Python", "LangChain", "RAG", "FastAPI", "React"] |
| `experience_years` | int | 0 (fresher) / 2 |
| `education` | object | { degree: "B.Tech CS", college: "NST", year: 2026 } |
| `projects` | list[object] | [{ name: "...", tech: [...], description: "..." }] |
| `target_roles` | list | ["AI Engineer", "GenAI Developer", "ML Intern"] |
| `preferred_locations` | list | ["Bangalore", "Remote", "Pune"] |
| `min_stipend` | int | 15000 |
| `weekly_quota` | int | 10 |
| `confirmation_mode` | string | "batch" (confirm all at once) or "individual" (confirm each one separately) - default "batch" |

**How profile is used downstream:**
- **Job Matching:** Profile embedding compared against JD embeddings
- **Resume Tailoring:** Skills and projects cherry-picked per JD
- **Prep Guide:** Skill gaps computed against JD requirements
- **Quota Selection:** Top N jobs ranked by profile-JD fit

---

### Module 2: Job Discovery Engine

**What it does:**
Scrapes career pages and portals to build a pool of 100+ relevant openings per cycle.

**Sources:**
- Company career pages (Lever, Greenhouse, Workable, custom)
- Job portals (LinkedIn Jobs, Internshala, Wellfound, etc.)
- Aggregator APIs (where available)

**Scraping Strategy:**

| Source Type | Tool | Approach |
|-------------|------|----------|
| Static HTML pages | BeautifulSoup | Direct parse |
| JS-rendered SPAs | Playwright | Headless browser, wait for content |
| API-backed portals | Requests | Direct API calls where possible |

**Data Extracted Per Job:**

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `company_name` | Career page |
| `role_title` | Listing |
| `jd_text` | Full job description |
| `skills_required` | Extracted from JD via LLM |
| `experience_required` | Parsed |
| `location` | Parsed |
| `stipend_salary` | Parsed (if available) |
| `application_url` | Direct link |
| `posting_date` | Parsed |
| `selection_process` | Extracted (if mentioned) - critical for prep guide |
| `company_website` | Scraped |
| `source` | "lever" / "greenhouse" / "linkedin" / etc. |

**Spam Filter:**
NLP classifier trained on signals: vague JDs, unrealistic salary claims, missing company details, known spam patterns. Confidence threshold - below threshold, the job is flagged and excluded.

---

### Module 3: Job-Profile Match Scorer

**What it does:**
Scores every discovered job against the user's profile. Produces a ranked list where rank 1 = best fit.

**Scoring Components:**

| Component | Weight | How It Works |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Skill Match** | 40% | Embedding similarity between user skills and JD required skills. Counts exact matches, partial matches, and missing skills |
| **Role Fit** | 20% | Semantic similarity between user's target roles and the job title/description |
| **Experience Fit** | 15% | Does user's experience level match? Fresher applying to 3+ year role = penalty |
| **Location Match** | 10% | User preference vs job location. Remote gets bonus if user prefers remote |
| **Stipend/Salary Fit** | 10% | Job stipend >= user's minimum? If undisclosed, neutral score |
| **Company Signal** | 5% | Verified company, clear JD, known brand = slight bonus |

**Output:**

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_042",
  "company": "AIBridge",
  "role": "Agentic AI Intern",
  "match_score": 0.87,
  "skill_match": {
    "matched": ["Python", "LangChain", "LLMs", "AI Agents"],
    "partial": ["TypeScript"],
    "missing": ["Vercel AI SDK"]
  },
  "skill_gap": ["Vercel AI SDK", "TypeScript"],
  "rank": 3
}
```

---

### Module 4: Weekly Quota Selector

**What it does:**
User says "10 per week." System picks top 10 from the ranked list and generates a Weekly Application Plan.

**Logic:**
1. Sort all jobs by `match_score` descending
2. Apply filters: exclude already-applied companies, expired listings, user blacklist
3. Pick top N (N = weekly quota)
4. Always send the weekly plan to the user for review - confirmation is mandatory, not optional
5. User confirms the full batch ("batch" mode) or approves each listing individually ("individual" mode)
6. After plan confirmation, generate tailored resumes and show each one to the user before submitting
7. Only after resume approval does the agent proceed to submit the application

**Weekly Application Plan (sent to user before execution):**

```
===============================================
   HIREFLOW WEEKLY PLAN - Week of June 9, 2026
   Quota: 10 jobs | Profile: Rahul Sharma
===============================================

   #1  AIBridge - Agentic AI Intern
       Match: 92% | Remote | 20-30k
       Skills Matched: 8/10 | Gap: TypeScript, Vercel AI SDK
   
   #2  Lemon Tea Studio - Software Dev Intern (GenAI)
       Match: 89% | Pune (Hybrid) | 25k
       Skills Matched: 7/9 | Gap: Angular
   
   #3  Augle AI - AI Engineer Intern
       Match: 85% | Pune | 20k
       Skills Matched: 6/10 | Gap: PyTorch, Edge Deployment
   
   ... (7 more)
   
   ---------------------------------
   [Confirm & Apply All]  [Edit List]
===============================================
```

---

### Module 5: Resume Tailoring Engine (Per Job)

**What it does:**
For each of the N selected jobs, generates a unique ATS-optimized resume tailored to that specific JD.

**Pipeline:**

```
Master Profile + JD
       |
       v
  Skill Extraction (from JD)
       |
       v
  Skill Mapping (which user skills match, which projects demonstrate them)
       |
       v
  Resume Section Generation (RAG)
       +-- Summary: Tailored to role
       +-- Skills: Reordered by JD priority
       +-- Experience: Relevant bullets emphasized
       +-- Projects: Top 2-3 most relevant selected
       +-- Education: Standard
       |
       v
  ATS Formatting (clean, parseable, keyword-rich)
       |
       v
  PDF Generation (using LaTeX / ReportLab)
       |
       v
  Resume stored: /resumes/{user_id}/{job_id}_resume.pdf
  Resume sent back to user in weekly report
```

**Key Design Decisions (Interview Hooks):**

| Decision | Options | Chosen | Why |
|----------|---------|--------|-----|
| Resume format | LaTeX vs HTML vs DOCX | LaTeX (XeLaTeX) | Best ATS parsing, consistent formatting |
| Skill reordering | Alphabetical vs JD-priority | JD-priority | First skills listed get more ATS weight |
| Project selection | All vs top-3 relevant | Top 2-3 by relevance score | Space-efficient, targeted |
| Summary generation | Template vs LLM-generated | LLM with constraints | Unique per JD but ATS-compliant |

**Resume Tracking:**
Every resume is version-controlled. User can see exactly which resume was sent to which company:

```json
{
  "application_id": "app_001",
  "job_id": "job_042",
  "company": "AIBridge",
  "role": "Agentic AI Intern",
  "resume_path": "/resumes/rahul/aibridge_agentic_ai_resume.pdf",
  "resume_version": "v1",
  "skills_highlighted": ["LangChain", "Python", "AI Agents", "LLMs"],
  "projects_included": ["ClaimFlow AI", "ScheduleGenie"],
  "applied_at": "2026-06-10T14:30:00Z",
  "status": "applied"
}
```

---

### Module 6: Preparation Guide Generator (Per Job)

**What it does:**
For every job applied to, generates a structured interview preparation guide. This is the "career coach" layer - the thing that makes HireFlow more than a bot.

**Guide Components:**

#### 6a. Interview Structure Prediction

The agent analyzes the JD and company career page to predict the interview process:

| Signal Source | What It Tells Us |
|---------------|-----------------|
| JD text | Often mentions "selection process" or "rounds" explicitly |
| Company career page | May describe hiring process |
| Company size/stage | Startup = 2-3 rounds, Enterprise = 4-5 rounds |
| Role type | Intern = lighter, Full-time = heavier |
| Web search | Glassdoor/AmbitionBox interview reviews |

**Output:**

```
EXPECTED INTERVIEW PROCESS
---------------------------
Predicted Rounds: 3
Confidence: High (process mentioned in JD)

Round 1: HR Screening (Telephonic)
  +-- Focus: Introduction, motivation, communication
  +-- Duration: ~15-20 min
  +-- Prep: Elevator pitch, "Why this company?", salary expectation

Round 2: Technical Round
  +-- Focus: Core concepts, problem-solving, project discussion
  +-- Duration: ~45-60 min
  +-- Topics: LangChain, RAG pipelines, AI Agents, Python
  +-- Prep: Be ready to explain your projects in depth

Round 3: Founder / Hiring Manager Round
  +-- Focus: Culture fit, ownership, product thinking
  +-- Duration: ~30 min
  +-- Prep: Company research, "What would you build?" questions
```

#### 6b. Topics & Skills to Prepare

Based on JD skill extraction + user's skill gap analysis:

```
TOPICS TO PREPARE
-----------------

STRONG (You already know - revise & be ready to go deep):
  1. Python - You have strong experience. Expect coding questions.
  2. LangChain - Your ClaimFlow project demonstrates this. Be ready
     to explain agent orchestration and state management.
  3. REST APIs - Your FastAPI experience covers this.

MODERATE (You know basics - need deeper prep):
  4. LLMs & Prompt Engineering - Study few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought,
     temperature/top-p tuning. Likely a discussion topic.
  5. AI Agents - Understand ReAct pattern, tool use, planning loops.
     Your projects cover this but prepare theoretical depth.

GAPS (Skills in JD that you're missing - start learning):
  6. TypeScript - JD mentions it. At minimum, understand basics and how
     it differs from Python. Resource: TypeScript Handbook (link)
  7. Vercel AI SDK - JD mentions it as "good to have." Quick overview
     recommended. Resource: Vercel AI SDK docs (link)
```

#### 6c. Curated Resources

For each topic, the agent finds relevant learning resources:

```
RESOURCES
---------

LangChain & Agents:
   LangChain Documentation - https://python.langchain.com/docs/
   "Building AI Agents with LangGraph" - DeepLearning.AI (link)
   Your own project: ClaimFlow AI - review your LangGraph code

TypeScript (Gap):
   TypeScript Handbook - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/
   "TypeScript in 1 Hour" - Fireship (YouTube)
   Practice: Convert one of your Python scripts to TypeScript

Vercel AI SDK (Gap):
   Official Docs - https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs
   "Build AI Apps with Vercel AI SDK" - (YouTube)

Company-Specific:
   AIBridge product - https://app.aibridge.one (explore it)
   Recent news about AIBridge - (web search result)
   Their tech blog (if available)
```

#### 6d. Company Intelligence

```
COMPANY INTEL
-------------

Company: AIBridge
Website: https://app.aibridge.one
Stage: Startup (early-stage)
Team Size: Small (~10-30 estimated)
Focus: Agentic AI systems, autonomous workflows
Tech Stack (inferred): Python, TypeScript, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK

Recent Activity:
   [Web search result: any recent funding, product launch, press]

Interview Pattern (from Glassdoor/AmbitionBox if available):
   [Scraped interview experiences if found]
   If not found: "No interview reviews found - this is a newer company.
    Expect a less structured process focused on problem-solving and
    cultural fit."

Key People:
   [Founder name from LinkedIn/website if publicly available]

What They Might Ask:
   "Build an AI agent that does X" - hands-on task likely
   "How would you architect a multi-agent system?" - design question
   "Walk us through a project where you used LangChain" - project deep dive
```

#### 6e. Mock Interview Questions (Generated Per JD)

```
LIKELY INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
--------------------------

Technical:
  1. What is an AI agent? How is it different from a chatbot?
  2. Explain the ReAct pattern. When would you use it vs a simple chain?
  3. Walk me through your [most relevant project]. What was the hardest part?
  4. How would you build a multi-agent system for [company's domain]?
  5. What is RAG? When would you use it vs fine-tuning?

Behavioral:
  6. Why do you want to work at [company]?
  7. Tell me about a time you learned something new quickly.
  8. How do you handle ambiguity in a project?

Design:
  9. Design an AI agent that can [task relevant to company's product].
  10. How would you evaluate whether an LLM-based feature is working well?
```

### Module 8: Hiring Side Agent (Optional)

**What it does:**
Flips the system: a company gets 100+ applications, and HireFlow shortlists the best 20-30.

**Flow:**
1. Company uploads JD + receives applications (CSV/JSON or scraped from portal)
2. Agent parses each application: extracts skills, experience, projects
3. Scores each applicant against JD (same scoring engine as candidate side)
4. Ranks and shortlists top N (company specifies: "give me top 20")
5. Generates shortlist report with per-candidate summary
6. Sends email to hiring team

**Shortlist Email to Hiring Team:**

```

## Pod Role Breakdown (Detailed)

### Maintainer
**Owns:** Repo architecture, LangGraph orchestration, state management, PR reviews, integration across all modules, M1 scaffold, M7 hiring side co-owner, M8 integration

**Key Files:**
- `src/agents/supervisor.py` - Main LangGraph workflow
- `src/config/` - All configuration
- `src/models/` - Data models (User, Job, Application, PrepGuide)

**Defense Questions:**
1. Walk me through the complete data flow from "user sets quota = 10" to "weekly report delivered."
2. How do agents coordinate? What's the state schema? What happens when the scraper fails mid-pipeline?
3. How would you add a new job source (e.g., a new portal) without changing the core architecture?

---

### Contributor 1 - Job Discovery Engine
**Owns:** M2 (Job Discovery + Spam Filter)

**Key Files:**
- `src/scrapers/lever_scraper.py`
- `src/scrapers/greenhouse_scraper.py`
- `src/scrapers/generic_scraper.py`
- `src/agents/spam_filter.py`

**Defense Questions:**
1. Why Playwright over Selenium? When would Selenium be better?
2. How do you handle career pages that load jobs via infinite scroll?
3. Your spam classifier flags a real startup with a sparse JD. How do you reduce false positives?
4. What's your scraping rate limit strategy? How do you avoid IP bans?
5. A career page changes its HTML structure overnight. How does your scraper handle this?

---

### Contributor 2 - Match Scorer + Resume Tailoring
**Owns:** M3 (Match Scorer) + M4 co-owner (Resume Engine)

**Key Files:**
- `src/pipelines/match_scorer.py`
- `src/pipelines/embedding_pipeline.py`
- `src/pipelines/resume_generator.py`
- `src/templates/resume_latex/`

**Defense Questions:**
1. What embedding model did you use? Why? How did you evaluate retrieval quality?
2. Why FAISS over ChromaDB for this use case?
3. Your match score weights skill at 40%. Why not 60%? How did you decide the weights?
4. Two jobs have the same match score (87%). How does the system break the tie?
5. What chunk size did you use for the RAG pipeline? What happens if the JD is very short (3 lines)?
6. How does the resume engine handle a user who has no relevant projects for a particular JD?
7. Why LaTeX for resume generation? What if the user wants a different format?

---

### Contributor 3 - Application Automation Agent
**Owns:** M5 (Application Automation) + M4 co-owner (Resume integration)

**Key Files:**
- `src/agents/application_agent.py`
- `src/automation/form_filler.py`
- `src/automation/captcha_handler.py`

**Defense Questions:**
1. How do you handle multi-page application forms? What if page 3 fails?
2. The career page has a CAPTCHA. You can't solve it. What does your agent do?
3. How do you avoid being detected as a bot? What anti-detection measures did you implement?
4. What's your retry strategy? After how many failures do you give up?
5. A form asks a free-text question: "Why do you want to work here?" How does your agent generate this?
6. How do you handle file upload fields for resume? What about cover letter fields?
7. How do you verify the application actually went through?

---

### Contributor 4 - Prep Guide Generator + Weekly Report
**Owns:** M6 (Prep Guide) + M7 co-owner (Weekly Report + Hiring Side)

**Key Files:**
- `src/agents/prep_guide_agent.py`
- `src/agents/company_intel_agent.py`
- `src/agents/report_generator.py`
- `src/agents/hiring_shortlist_agent.py`

**Defense Questions:**
1. How do you predict the number of interview rounds when the JD doesn't mention it?
2. Your prep guide recommends resources. How do you ensure the links are valid and high-quality?
3. How do you generate mock interview questions that are specific to the JD, not generic?
4. The company has zero Glassdoor reviews. How does your company intel module handle this?
5. For the hiring side: how do you prevent bias in shortlisting? What if the scoring penalizes non-traditional backgrounds?
6. The weekly report has 10 prep guides. How do you keep them distinct and not repetitive?
7. How do you prioritize which skill gap to study first when multiple JDs have different gaps?

        -> sends Weekly Plan: "Here are your top 10. Confirm?"
        Rahul reviews -> swaps #8 with #11 -> confirms

Day 2-3: HireFlow generates 10 tailored resumes -> applies to 9 
         (1 failed: Augle AI had CAPTCHA)
         -> generates 10 prep guides

Day 3: Rahul receives Weekly Report:
       - 9 applications with resumes attached
       - 10 prep guides with topics, rounds, resources
       - Cross-application insight: "Learn TypeScript this week"
       - Augle AI flagged: "Manual apply needed (CAPTCHA)"

Day 4-7: Rahul studies using prep guides. Gets interview call from AIBridge.
         Opens prep guide -> reviews predicted rounds, topics, mock questions.
         Aces the interview.

Day 8: Next weekly cycle begins automatically.
