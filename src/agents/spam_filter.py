        You are an expert NLP classifier for a job board. Your task is to analyze the following job listing and score it for spam (0.0 = completely legitimate, 1.0 = obvious spam).
        
        Spam indicators to look for:
        - Vague "rockstar" or "ninja" language without any actual substance.
        - Unrealistic salary claims or promises.
        - Extremely short description (under 50 words) with NO specific technical skills mentioned.
        
        IMPORTANT EXCEPTION:
        A short description (e.g., 20 words) from a legitimate startup that mentions specific technical skills (e.g. "Python", "React", "Data Pipeline") is NOT spam. Score it very low (e.g., 0.1).
        
        Job Data:
        - Company: {company}
        - Description: {jd_text[:3000]}  # truncated for safety
        - Skills: {job_data.get("skills_required", [])}
        
        Return ONLY valid JSON with two keys:
        - "spam_confidence": a float between 0.0 and 1.0
        - "reasoning": a brief explanation for your score
