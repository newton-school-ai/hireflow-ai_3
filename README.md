# HireFlow AI

Career autopilot for students. HireFlow discovers jobs and internships, tailors your resume for each one, applies on your behalf, and gives you a prep guide - all in one weekly cycle.

## What Does HireFlow Do?

You tell HireFlow:
- Your resume and skills
- How many applications you want per week (e.g. 10)
- What roles you are targeting ("AI Engineer Intern", "ML Developer")
- Mode: Internship or Full-time Job

HireFlow then:
1. Discovers 100+ relevant openings from career pages and portals
2. Scores every listing against your profile and picks the best matches
3. Sends you a weekly plan - "here are your top 10, review before we proceed"
4. You confirm, swap, or remove any listing. Nothing is submitted without your approval.
5. Tailors your resume specifically for each confirmed role (a different resume per company)
6. Shows you each tailored resume before it is sent - you can edit or reject
7. Applies to all confirmed listings using form-filling automation
8. Sends you a weekly report with every resume used and a prep guide for each company

It also works in reverse - companies can use HireFlow to shortlist the best applicants from a pile of 100+ resumes.

## Two Modes

**Internship Mode**
- Targets internship listings (Internshala, Wellfound, LinkedIn internships, company pages)
- Filters by stipend range
- Resume and prep guide tuned for fresher and early-career profiles
- Interview prep covers lighter, shorter rounds typical of internship hiring

**Job Mode**
- Targets full-time job listings (LinkedIn, Naukri, Greenhouse, Lever, company pages)
- Filters by salary range
- Resume tailored for experienced or final-year profiles
- Interview prep covers multi-round structured hiring processes

The user selects a mode at profile setup. Both modes use the same core pipeline - scrapers, scorer, resume engine, application agent, and prep guide generator.

## Getting Started (Local Setup)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher (for frontend)
- Docker (optional but recommended)
- PostgreSQL

### Step 1 - Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/newton-school-ai/hireflow-ai.git
cd hireflow-ai
```

### Step 2 - Set up Python environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3 - Configure environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in your API keys
```

### Step 4 - Run with Docker (easiest)
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Or run manually:
```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

Note: Docker is optional for development. Students working on individual modules only need steps 1 to 3. Docker is required for deployment.

## How to Contribute

Read CONTRIBUTING.md for the full workflow. Short version:

1. Find an open issue assigned to your milestone
2. Comment "I am working on this" to claim it
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Write your code, commit with clear messages
5. Open a PR, Maintainer reviews, merge only when all criteria are met

AI tools are allowed. But you must be able to explain every decision in your code. If you used LangChain, know why. If you chose FAISS over ChromaDB, know why.

## Milestone Q&A (Accountability Sessions)

Every 2 to 3 days, students sit with faculty for a short Q&A on what was built in that sprint:
- Contributors: Why this solution? What other approaches exist?
- Maintainer: Why did you approve this PR? What did you check?
- Faculty probes: Edge cases, error handling, design decisions
